# Integrated Project: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis

## 📘 Overview
This project explores the Maji Ndogo water crisis through SQL queries, analysis scripts, and insights derived from the Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Dataset . The goal of this project is to analyze water accessibility and infrastructure issues in Maji Ndogo, identify key challenges, and propose data-driven solutions to improve water access for its citizens.

The dataset includes information about:
- Employee records (e.g., surveyors, field workers).
- Water sources (e.g., shared taps, wells, rivers).
- Queue times for water collection.
- Locations of water sources across provinces and towns.
Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, prioritize repairs, and provide actionable recommendations to address the water crisis effectively.
