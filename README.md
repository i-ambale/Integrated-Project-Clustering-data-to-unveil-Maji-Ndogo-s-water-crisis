# Integrated Project: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis

## 📘 Overview
This project explores the Maji Ndogo water crisis through clustering and SQL-based analysis. The dataset contains information about water sources, queue times, survey visits, and field data collected across towns and provinces in Maji Ndogo. Using this data, we aim to uncover systemic issues, identify high-impact infrastructure problems, and propose data-driven solutions.

## 🧠 Project Objective
To analyze water infrastructure and collection behavior in Maji Ndogo in order to:
- Identify trends in water access.
- Cluster water sources by usage and condition.
- Highlight areas of greatest need.
- Provide actionable recommendations for resource allocation and repair efforts.
---
## 📊 Key Questions Answered
- What times and days see the highest queue times?
- What percentage of the population relies on different water source types?
- Which sources serve the most people and should be prioritized?
- How are locations and field efforts distributed across provinces?
